My Answers:

Selenium IDE:
It is a firefox plugin which will be used for record & Playback
very difficult to maintain the scripts
It will not import the libs
Data connection & Condtional statments it will not understand.

Remote Control:

It is a server which will inject the some java codes(ex : some libs which we will not know) to work on multiple browsers (Only firefox is having in bulit in lib and others are not having the lib)

Web driver:
Web driver eliminates  RC drawback to work the browser without having the external injected code.

My colleague answers:

Selenium IDE:
FireFox Add in
Record and Playback Tool
Difficult to Maintain
Can't import Other lib

Selenium RC:
Multiple browser
Each browser Acts as a client
Inject java script code to browser
Since except firefox other browsers have selenium lib.
